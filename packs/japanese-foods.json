There are many variations within these themes, including regional variations, such as Shinshū miso or Sendai miso.\n<br>\nA miso paste that has been fermented for a longer period of time, such as a red miso, gives the miso soup a stronger, deeper flavor. A miso paste that has been fermented for a shorter period of time, such as a white miso, provides a lighter, sweeter flavor.\n<br>\nMore than 80% of Japan's total annual production of miso goes into miso soup, and 75% of all Japanese people consume miso soup at least once a day.<br><br>Originates from: Miso soup",

The dish is frequently cooked at the table, and the diners can pick the cooked ingredients they want from the pot. It is either eaten with the broth or with a dip. Further ingredients can also be successively added to the pot.\n<br>\nThere are two types of <i>nabemono</i> in Japan.One type uses a lightly flavored stock, flavored mostly with <i>kombu</i>. This type includes varieties such as <i>yudōfu</i> and <i>mizutaki </i>, eaten with a dipping sauce (<i>tare</i>) to enjoy the taste of the ingredients themselves.\n<br>\nThe other type uses a strongly flavored stock, typically made with some combination of miso, soy sauce, dashi, and sweet soy.This type include varieties such as<i> yosenabe</i>, <i>oden</i>, and <i>sukiyaki</i>, eaten without further flavoring.\n<br>\nThe pots are traditionally made of clay or thick cast iron. Clay pots can keep warm for a while after being taken off the fire, while cast iron pots evenly distribute heat and are preferable for <i>sukiyaki</i>. Pots are usually placed in the center of dining tables and are shared by multiple people. This is considered the most sociable way to eat with friends and family.<br><br>Originates from: Nabemono",

Some <i>amezaiku</i> artists are also street performers who perform magic tricks and tell stories along with their candy craft entertainment.<br>The candy base is prepared beforehand, using a starchy syrup recipe that requires careful monitoring to ensure proper consistency and appearance. The mixture is kneaded and pulled by hand, and formed into a large ball to be stored until ready to use. At the stall, the candy ball is heated to make it pliable again. The artist puts their hand into the hot mass to pinch up the material necessary; this, too, is a skill, as the artist must learn to tolerate the painful heat of the medium. The hot candy is quickly rolled and mounted on a stick, then pulled, twisted and clipped into form, usually an animal of some kind and often intricate. Speed is necessary to the art since the sculpture must be completed before the candy cools and hardens again.<br>One method formerly used in sculpting <i>amezaiku</i> was blowing into the candy by means of a straw, similar to glass-blowing.

When the viper is thawed and awakens, it will quickly die in an aggressive striking manner, which is what most producers look for.

To continue the process, the habu is put in a 59% alcohol mix for 40 days and finally put in a 35% <i>awamori</i> mix to prepare for consumption.
